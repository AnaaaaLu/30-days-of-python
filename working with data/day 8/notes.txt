While Loops:
    useful for when you want to perform an action as many times as needed 
        until a condition is met, or while a condition is true 
    simpler than a for loop 
        you just need to use the while keyword, followed by a condition to be tested 
            while datatype(variableName) condition: 
                what to do if the condition is met   
    if the condition is a truthy value the loop will run and then test 
        the condition again
    you need to declare the variable before using it in the loop 
    
Infinite Loops:
    dont need to use comparisons, just specify a value and the truthiness 
        of it will determinate if the loop keeps going or not
    all expressions are going to evaluate to something 
    function calls, arithmetic operations or we can refer to variables. 
    for an infinite loop we want an expression that will always be a 
        truthy value 
        a good example is the boolean "true" value 
    its good practice to pair an infinite loop with an break or an else 
        statement

The continue keyword:
    while "break" allows to exit a loop, continue allows to skip the 
        remainer of the loop body for the current iteration 
    can help simplify the code 

Using an else clause with loops:
    else is a no break clause 
    only runs if there isnt an break clause during the execution
