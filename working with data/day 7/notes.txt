Converting Tuples into Strings:
    join method is the best
        .join(tupleOrListName)
    * can be put inside {} to be printed just like any place holder 
    using .join we can only join collections of strings, so numbers need to be converted into strings before being called 

Splitting up a string:
    .split:
        you might prefer to turn strings into a collection instead if reverser method
            listName = stringName.split("splitter")
        split wont remove any spaces in the input, for that you need to pair it with strip
        if how you want to split isnt specified, it will automatically be split with spaces
    calling split isnt always necessary you can just pass the string to the list or tuple function instead

The newline character:
    \n 
     * can be used in the middle of strings ass well, doesnt need to be declared before 
     ** it can also be used to split strings

Slicing: 
    to just grab a part of an collection
    needs to provide a range of indices instead of a single one 
    written as: [firstIndex : lastIndex]
     * you can also just provide the last index if you want to start the index from the beggining of the string to be splitted
    with slices the stop index isn't inclusive 
    with an negative stop index, it'll subtract the number before the - from the end of the portion 
    to copy an entire collection you can slice the whole sequence using: [:]

The len function:
    len is short for length, it works for strings, tuples, lists and and other types
     * but not int
    used to return an int representing the number of items in the collection
