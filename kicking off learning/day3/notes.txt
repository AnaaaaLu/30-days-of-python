string concatenation:
    joining strings together
    can use the + for it

Converting strings, integers and floats:
    int to string: 
        -> using the str function
            str(integer)
    string to int:
        -> using the int function
            int(string)
    int to float:
        -> using the float function
            float(integer)

string interpolation:
    inserting new content into an existing string
    uses the "format" method
    uses {} for placeholders
        "{} string {}".format()
    the placeholder can have information inside it, so they can be located

f-strings:
    placeholder = "whatever"
    placeholder2 = "whatever2"
    f"{placeholder} string {placeholder2} string"
    the f before tells that you want to format the whole instance

comments: 
    start with #

basic string processing 
    "string    ".lower()        -> makes it lowercase
                .upper()        -> makes uppercase
                .capitalize()   -> capitalizes its first word
                .title()        -> capitalizes every word
                .strip()        -> by default removes the empty space in a string, can remove anything, but by defauld does this

processing multiple times:
    create a variable for the string and then add as many of the processing thingy to the variable
        string_variable = "     string     "
        string_variable.strip().upper
    another way to do this, is just to add as many as you want formatters to the string in the above section
