String basics:
    need to be in quotes (""), just like in java
    doesn't matter if they are in '' or "", just don't start with one and end with the other 
    if a string has a space in it, it's not empty 

Naming Values: 
    just write the name and add an = to the expression, no need to declare anything
    rules: 
        only letters, numbers and _ 
        can't start with a number, but can start with _ 
        are case sensitive 
        CAN'T HAVE - 
    conventions: 
        avoid using variables that don't have any meaning, they should make the code easier to read, not harder
        always start with a lowercase 

retrieving valuables: 
    literally just write its name 
    remember to declare it before calling, python is linear

User Input: 
    literarally just use the function input(), it makes so you can type in the console
    you can write the context directly in the function like: 
        input("whatever")
        * but then the user will write ditectly next to the phrase printed 
    input evaluates to string natively 
    whatever = input("whatever  ") -> will assign a value to the variable
