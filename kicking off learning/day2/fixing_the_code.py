#Below you’ll find some code with a number of errors. Try to go through 
# the program line by line and fix the issues in the code. I’d encourage 
# you to try running the program while you’re working on it, as reading 
# the error messages is great practice for debugging your own programs.

#code fixed: 

hourly_wage = input("Please enter your hourly wage: ")

hours_worked = input("How many hours did you work this week? ")

print("Hourly wage: ")
print(hourly_wage)
print("Hours worked: ")
print(hours_worked)
