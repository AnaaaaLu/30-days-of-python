integers and floats are the basis: 
    int = whole
        * just write the number, no need to declare
            4 
            -6
    float = real
        * also just write the number, no need to declare

Print is a built in function in python, to call it just write: 
    print(3.141) -> dont put an " " between the function and expression, its a bad practice

Multiple operations in python obey the following the PEMDAS sequence: 
    Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication/Division, Addition/Subtraction

You should always put spaces between opeartors and numbers, to have a better readability.
