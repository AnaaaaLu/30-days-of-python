Defining a For Loop:
    for whatever in wherever:
        statement to be looped
    In keyword -> says from what code we want to grab the stuff from
    there needs to be indentation in the for loop 
    when a for loop is run, we start iterating over the iterable we provided, and assign it to the name we defined as part of the loop 
        * the iterable is where we are pulling the values from
    the loop ends when we run out of values
    you can loop a list
    you can indent an if statement in a loop

Style Note:
    remember to accurately describe what data you are working with, a good way to do it is to relate its name with the iterable
    
The Break Statement
    used to end a loop, to prevent unnecessary operations

Range Function:
    produces a series of integers according to a pattern
    the easiest way to define a range is providing its stop value
        range(stopValue)
    if you give it a number to stop, it will start running from 0 
    you can also assign an start value
        range(startValue, stopValue)
    it's also possible to assign a step value
        range(startValue, stopValue, stepValue)
            * the step value can be positive or negative
    when a range is printed, it will only give us the next value in it
    can be used in for loops and be converted into a list or tuple
        variableName = list(range(stopValue))
        variableName = tuple(range(stopValue))

Using Range in For loops
    for variableName in range(stopValue)
        statement to be looped
    * the output of this code will happen the stopValue of times

Style Note:
    descriptive names, dont forget
