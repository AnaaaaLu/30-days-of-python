Booleans: 
    only 2 values, True and False
        * capitalization needed!
    can be used just like any other datatype 

Truth Values: 
    every value in python has an associated truth value
    bool function reveals if the value is a truthy or a falsy value
        * print(bool(value))

What makes an Value Falsy:
    any numeric representation of 0
    values false and none 
    empty sequences and collections
        * any statement can be made falsy with advanced python knowledge
        * any other value in python is truthy

Comparison Operators:
    when used you get an true or false boolean
    1. <        -> less than
    2. >        -> greater than
    3. <=       -> less than or equal to 
    4. >=       -> greater than or equal to
    5. ==       -> values are equivalent
    6. !=       -> not equivalent
    7. is       -> checks if something is EXACTLY the same as the other
    8. is not   -> checks if something is EXACTLY the same as the other
        * 7 and 8 check if the object is stored in the same place of memory
        ** you can know where something is stored through the "id" function
        *** even if the subject have the same id it can yield False, because they occupy the same place but arent the same thing, happens when a memory address has been reused

Order of Operations: 
    always lower priority than arithmetic operators 

Conditional Statement:
    if keyword works just like so: 
        if subject < whatever: 
            statement
    the statement needs to be indented
    the else works the same way, but an if is required for it to be used
    elif, woreks just like if, but an if is required to use it

Truth Values and Conditional Statements:
    the truth value od any value can be used as a condition in code
