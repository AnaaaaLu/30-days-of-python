Lists: 
    can have different types of values
    each value in "" and are separated with , (its recommended to put 
        an space after the comma, though not required)
    stored inside []
    can be empty
    do all of the list in single line or with every value in a new line, 
        for a better redability 

Acessing Values in a List:
    all values are indexed, starting with an 0 
    Subscription Expression = how to acess an specific value in a 
        list
            write the name of the list and add [item location]
            to do an negative index, put an - in the number, so the 
                function will work backwards, -1 = the last item, 
                and so on

Adding Items to Lists:
    Append Method: 
        adds an item to the end of the list 
        .append(value) after the name of the list 

    you can also use list = list + ["value"]
        this method creates a new list that substitutes the one that 
            existed before
    
    Extend Method:
        can be used to add more than one item in the end, used just 
            like append
    
    Insert Method:
    used to add in the middle of the list 
    can be more tricky, because you need to say in what position you 
        want it in 
    list name.insert(position, value)
    * if you add in an index that doesnt exist in there, the item 
        will be added in the end 

Removing Items from a List:
    Remove Method:
        used as any other method viewed before 
        removes the item that matches the value added in the ()
        after, everything shuffles to the side so we wont have an 
            empty space
    
    Del Keyword:
        can remove enything and everything if needed 
        if used like so: del listName[indexValue], will remove only 
            the indexed value said in there
    
    Pop Method:
        if used raw removes the last item in the list 
            -> listName.pop()
        if you put the index number in the (), will remove that 
            value instead
        
        OTHER USE: 
            pop evaluates the list item, so you can use this method 
                to call the last name of said list, like so: 
                    lastInList = listname.pop()
    
    Clear Method: 
        will clear the list. 

Tuples: 
    similar to lists, can be written just like them, but the [] 
        arent required, can be substituted with (), or just not 
        have them. 
    only , are important
    can be put inside lists, to put multiple values together as an 
        single value
            * in this case you cant forget the (), otherwise you 
                will have only an list, not an list with tuples 
                inside it
    to write an tuple with only one subject it should be written 
        like so: 
            tupleName = ("subject", ) or tupleName = "subject", 

Acessing Values in a Tuple:
    can be acessed just like and list, by indexing 

Tuples vs Lists: 
    Tuples are IMMUTABLE, once created cant be changed
    so, you cant use .append or .pop, and del will delete the whole 
        thing
    you can only use + to join 2 tuples
    tuples are better when you need that an convention will be 
        mainteined throughout the whole thing
            *useful for libraries

Acessing values in nested collections:
    you need to acess it via index, like so listNam[index]
    to acess an specific value in a tuple inside an list, you need 
        to use double indexes
            listName[listIndex][tupleIndex]
                *its equivalent of doing so: 
                    listName = listName[]
                    listName[]
